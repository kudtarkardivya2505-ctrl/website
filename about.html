<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p class="text">GlowSkin is a skincare brand dedicated to making skin healthier using natural formulas.
As a practising Bach flower therapist, vegetarian and skincare activist, I am an entrepreneur who wears many hats and juggles many roles. As a lifelong environmentalist and self-proclaimed conservationist driven by passion, I have taken it upon myself to design skincare solutions which are completely of the earth, and easy for women and men to incorporate into their daily lives. All personally handcrafted in small batches, my natural skincare products are carefully made with lots of love. As they say, the proof is in the pudding. This is a plant-based, truly organic approach to skincare, for beautifully flawless complexion.</p>
<p>We believe beauty starts with self-care, and here is a glimpse of our product that includes the following.</p>
<h3>Key ingredients for glowing skin:</h3>
<li><b>Vitamin C:</b>A potent antioxidant that helps reduce dark spots, brighten dull skin, and boost collagen production.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Niacinamide (Vitamin B3):</b> Balances oil production, calms inflammation, and helps fade pigmentation for a more even complexion.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Hyaluronic Acid:</b>A powerful humectant that draws and retains moisture in the skin, giving a plump, dewy, and hydrated appearance.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Glycolic Acid (AHA):</b>A gentle exfoliant that removes dead skin cells and encourages cell turnover, revealing brighter skin underneath.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Retinol:</b>Works overnight to speed up cell turnover, reduce fine lines, and improve skin texture for a smoother, brighter look.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Ceramides:</b>Essential for repairing and strengthening the skin's natural moisture barrier, which helps retain hydration and protect against environmental stressors.</li>
